In this repository, we are going to write a code to integrate a 1D dimensional integration using Monte Carlo, this method can be extended to higher order dimensional integration.

The example integration being solved for is, 
\[ int_0^1 x^2 dx \]

The code is written in python. Feel free to contact me, if you need help.
