# Monte Carlo's integration

- In this repository, we are going to write a code to integrate a 1D dimensional integration using Monte Carlo, this method can be extended to higher order dimensional integration. 



- The example integration being solved for is, 

$$\int_0^1 x^2 dx$$

- The code is written and executed using python 3. In order to use the code you need to make sure that numpy package is installed in your device, else the code will throw an error, you can check whether the package is installed via terminal for linux using the following 
   pip3 show numpy
If the package is installed, the code would pirnt out the version information of the package, else you can use the following called to have numpy installed in your device,
    pip3 install numpy
